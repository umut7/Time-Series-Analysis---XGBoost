# Energy Consumption Prediction with XGBoost  

This project demonstrates how to handle time-series data, perform feature engineering, and build an energy consumption prediction model using XGBoost. The analysis includes feature engineering, data visualization, model training, prediction, and evaluation. The workflow can be extended to other time-series prediction problems.  

## Results  
- **RMSE on Test Set:**  
  The model achieves an RMSE score of `1649.42`.  
- **Visualizations:**  
  Predictions are compared to actual data, showing the model's performance over time.
